### vRoom

#### _ a virtual 3d mood board controlled by voice_

vRoom is a serverless voice controlled 3d mood board creator.

Use the wake word 'Hello' to activate our chatbot Vee. You can then request images by saying 'I want to see some images' or 'Find me some images' - Vee will send a request to the PixaBay API which will return images related to your search term.

Images can be 'liked', deleted, and moved in 3d space.

*unstable*  You can also ask Vee to play a song with the command 'Play me a song' - Vee will send a request to the YouTube API and return the most popular video related to your request and play the audio for this video. Please note that currently Vee struggles with longer search terms - try and limit your request to one or two words.

#### Voice Commands

Wake word:

> 'Hello'

Image search:

> 'Can you find me some images' & 'I want to see some images'

Song request:

>'Play me a song'

Vee will then ask you what you would like to see / hear, and will then confirm your search term before sending off a request.

This app was built in 2 weeks during the final project sprint at NorthCoders - https://www.northcoders.com/
